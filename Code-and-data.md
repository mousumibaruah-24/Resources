Rules from https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf

* Automation
  - Automate everything that can be automated
  - Write a single script that executes all code from beginning to end

* Directories
  - Separate directories by function
  - Separate files into inputs and outputs
  - Make directories portable

* Keys
  - Store cleaned data in tables with unique, non-missing keys
  - Keep data normalized as far into your code pipeline as you can

* Abstraction
  - Abstract to eliminate redundancy
  - Abstract to improve clarity
  - Otherwise, don’t abstract

* Documentation 
  - Don’t write documentation you will not maintain
  - Code should be self-documenting

* Management
  - Manage tasks with a task management system
  - E-mail is not a task management system

* Code Style
  - Make your functions shy
  - Order your functions for linear reading
  - Use descriptive names
  - Pay special attention to coding algebra
  - Make logical switches intuitive
  - Be consistent
  - Check for errors
