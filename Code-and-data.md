[The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/): "Long time Pythoneer Tim Peters succinctly channels the BDFL's guiding principles for Python's design into 20 aphorisms, only 19 of which have been written down."

* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Flat is better than nested.
* Sparse is better than dense.
* Readability counts.
* Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
* Although practicality beats purity.
* Errors should never pass silently.
* Unless explicitly silenced.
* In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
* There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
* Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
* Now is better than never.
* Although never is often better than *right* now.
* If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
* If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
* Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Some more rules copied from https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf

* Automation
  - Automate everything that can be automated
  - Write a single script that executes all code from beginning to end

* Directories
  - Separate directories by function
  - Separate files into inputs and outputs
  - Make directories portable

* Keys
  - Store cleaned data in tables with unique, non-missing keys
  - Keep data normalized as far into your code pipeline as you can

* Abstraction
  - Abstract to eliminate redundancy
  - Abstract to improve clarity
  - Otherwise, don’t abstract

* Documentation 
  - Don’t write documentation you will not maintain
  - Code should be self-documenting

* Management
  - Manage tasks with a task management system
  - E-mail is not a task management system

* Code Style
  - Make your functions shy
  - Order your functions for linear reading
  - Use descriptive names
  - Pay special attention to coding algebra
  - Make logical switches intuitive
  - Be consistent
  - Check for errors
