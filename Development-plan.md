* Goal setting is a helpful strategy for career advancement 
* Please write up an individual development plan (IDP) for yourself:
  - It should include a career objective, a baseline skills assessment (you can use [imaginephd.com](https://www.imaginephd.com/) for this) and time-bound goals. 
  - Resources to help you draft an IDP are available in the [repository](https://github.com/aadityadar/all-aboard/tree/master/development_plan)

* Few clarifications:
  - I haven't come across an IDP for pre-docs (please send me one if you do) so using one for [grad students](https://github.com/aadityadar/all-aboard/blob/master/development_plan/idp_grad_ucsd.docx) seems natural
  - Given that you are an early stage of your career, I recommend the following structure but please, by all means, modify the IDP to suit your needs:
    - Duration of the training period (two years instead of five) 
    - Frequency of review (biannual instead of annual) 
    - Number of goals (at least four every review cycle, with at least one that is relevant for (a) improving research productivity, (b) conducting research activities, and (c) professional development)
  - Writing the IDP might involve some trade-offs. Please don't overburden yourself with too many classes -- remember: you just need to be prepared for a PhD and you don't need to complete all the PhD coursework before starting your PhD!
