Asking good questions is not easy and takes practice. Be clear, specific and concise. A decent format is:
* I am trying to do XX
* I tried XX and got the error XX (mention all relevant attempts)
* Screenshot attached/code and error pasted below

Read the following resources:

* [Statalist](https://www.statalist.org/forums/help#sources) offers great advice on how to ask questions. 

> 9. Where may I look for other advice on posting technical questions?
> 
> You might find various websites that discuss general issues in getting help from technical lists and forums instructive and even amusing. Mike Ash discusses “Getting answers” at http://www.mikeash.com/getting_answers.html, with key headings:
> 
>     Explain what doesn’t work
>     Provide everything up-front
>     Post your code
>     Do your research beforehand
>     Do your research during
>     Do your research afterwards
>     Don’t post the same question repeatedly
>     Follow up after you get an answer
>     Treat the list like people
>     Always consider the answer
> 
> Eric Raymond and Rick Moen discuss “How to ask questions the smart way” at http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html.
> 
> Asking about your real problem, not something else, may seem too obvious to mention, but do check http://xyproblem.info/.
> 
> 10. How should I write questions?
> 
> Do write carefully; be precise and include all relevant detail.
> 
> For instance,
> 
>     Don't say "Stata crashed" when you mean "Stata issued an error message" (and then tell us the error message). Say crashed only if you mean crashed as in crashed and burned.
>     Don't say "many variables", say "around 50 variables" or, even better, "52 variables".
>     Don't say "a big dataset", say "a dataset of 50 variables and approximately a million observations".
>     Don't say "I ran a regression and then ...", say "I ran regress and then ...". 
> 
> Please pay attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, and tidy, readable presentation generally. Statalist is naturally sympathetic whenever it is clear that English is not your first language (which is another reason to use your real name). 

* [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way by Eric Steven Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

> Use meaningful, specific subject headers
> Make it easy to reply
> Write in clear, grammatical, correctly-spelled language
> Send questions in accessible, standard formats
> Be precise and informative about your problem
> Volume is not precision
> Don't rush to claim that you have found a bug
> Grovelling is not a substitute for doing your homework
> Describe the problem's symptoms, not your guesses
> Describe your problem's symptoms in chronological order
> Describe the goal, not the step
> Don't ask people to reply by private e-mail
> Be explicit about your question

* [XY problem](https://xyproblem.info/)

> The XY problem is asking about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem. This leads to enormous amounts of wasted time and energy, both on the part of people asking for help, and on the part of those providing help.
> 
>     User wants to do X.
>     User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y.
>     User doesn't know how to do Y either.
>     User asks for help with Y.
>     Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.
>     After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn't even a suitable solution for X.
