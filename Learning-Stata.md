If you are new to Stata, I start with the following:

1) Baum, C. F. (2006). An introduction to modern econometrics using Stata: A Stata Press publication. https://www.dropbox.com/s/ttixl3sp3rmrgxr/Christopher%20F.%20Baum%20-%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Modern%20Econometrics%20Using%20Stata-Stata%20Press%20%282006%29.pdf?dl=0

2) Make your way through Lembcke's intro notes to Stata:  
http://personal.lse.ac.uk/lembcke/ecStata/2010/MResStataNotesOct2010PartA.pdf

- You need to be comfortable with Ch 2 "DATABASE MANIPULATION" (but do read Ch 1 as well)

3) Stata's documentation is excellent (and all their videos are on YouTube) http://www.stata.com/links/video-tutorials/

- Your best friend in Stata will be the -help- command.

Note: There are a lot of resources on Stata on the web and some important ones are:

- ATS UCLA www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/

- DSS Princeton http://dss.princeton.edu/training/

I generally find it useful to point students to one material to avoid looking at multiple webpages etc. Therefore, I would strongly recommend starting with LSE notes or Baum's textbook, supplementing it with Stata's video tutorials when need be.

When in doubt, ask! [Statalist](https://www.statalist.org)is an amazing resource but before posting make sure you have read https://www.statalist.org/forums/help
