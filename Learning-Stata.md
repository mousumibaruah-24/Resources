If you are new to Stata, I start with the following:

* [Christopher F. Baum's An Introduction to Modern Econometrics Using Stata](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ttixl3sp3rmrgxr/Christopher%20F.%20Baum%20-%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Modern%20Econometrics%20Using%20Stata-Stata%20Press%20%282006%29.pdf?dl=0)

* Make your way through [Lembcke's intro notes to Stata](
http://personal.lse.ac.uk/lembcke/ecStata/2010/MResStataNotesOct2010PartA.pdf)

  - Advanced topics are covered in [Part B](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/lembcke/ecStata/2009/MResStataNotesFeb2009PartB.pdf)

* Stata's documentation is excellent (and all their videos are on [YouTube](http://www.stata.com/links/video-tutorials/)) 

  - Your best friend in Stata will be the -help- command.

* There are a lot of resources on Stata on the web and some important ones are:
  - [ATS UCLA](www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/)
  - [DSS Princeton](http://dss.princeton.edu/training/)

* I generally find it useful to point students to one material to avoid looking at multiple webpages etc. Therefore, I would strongly recommend starting with LSE notes or Baum's textbook, supplementing it with Stata's video tutorials when need be.

* When in doubt, ask! [Statalist](https://www.statalist.org) is an amazing resource but before posting make sure you have read the [advice on posting](https://www.statalist.org/forums/help )
