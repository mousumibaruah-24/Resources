If you are new to Stata, please start with the following:

* (Basic Stata training](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/stata/modules/)

* [IPA Stata training](https://github.com/PovertyAction/IPA-Stata-Trainings). Click on Code > Download ZIP to save repository locally.

* Download, print and pin [Stata cheat sheets](https://www.stata.com/bookstore/stata-cheat-sheets/)

* [Christopher F. Baum's An Introduction to Modern Econometrics Using Stata](https://www.stata.com/bookstore/modern-econometrics-stata/)

* Make your way through [Lembcke's intro notes to Stata](
http://personal.lse.ac.uk/lembcke/ecStata/2010/MResStataNotesOct2010PartA.pdf)

  - Advanced topics are covered in [Part B](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/lembcke/ecStata/2009/MResStataNotesFeb2009PartB.pdf)

* *At the very least*, cover chapters 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 and 9 from [Cameron and Trivedi's Microeconometrics Using Stata](https://www.stata.com/bookstore/microeconometrics-stata/)

* Stata's documentation is excellent (and all their videos are on [YouTube](http://www.stata.com/links/video-tutorials/)) 

  - Your best friend in Stata will be the -help- command.

* There are a lot of resources on Stata on the web and some important ones are:
  - [ATS UCLA](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/stata/)
  - [DSS Princeton](http://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/)

* I generally find it useful to point students to one material to avoid looking at multiple webpages etc. Therefore, I would strongly recommend starting with LSE notes or Baum's textbook, supplementing it with Stata's video tutorials when need be.
  - The only other *required* reading on this list is Cameron and Trivedi 2009

* When in doubt, ask! [Statalist](https://www.statalist.org) is an amazing resource but before posting make sure you have read the [advice on posting](https://www.statalist.org/forums/help)
