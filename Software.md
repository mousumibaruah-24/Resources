We will be using the following tools and apps:

* Stata
  - At some point I will hopefully transition to R but for now Stata is the preferred software for analysis
  - Please use [Stata/MP](https://www.stata.com/statamp/) as it is efficient when working with large data
  - Link ST3 with Stata https://github.com/mattiasnordin/StataEditor
  - Install frequently used [user defined commands](Stata-ado)

* Python 
  - Python is a powerful programing language that has multiple uses, from data scraping to text analysis
  - Install [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

* ArcMap
  - Used for GIS and spatial analysis
  - If you don't have access to Arc, the open source alternative is [QGIS](https://qgis.org)

* Sublime Text
  - A good text editor can save hours during coding
  - Install [ST3](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  - Learn multi-line editing and shortcuts (such as Alt+F3)
  - Integrate [ST with Stata and TeX and download frequently used packages](st-packages)

* LaTeX
  - LaTeX is an incredible typesetting program that creates pretty PDFs
  - Depending on the specific project we might need an online collaboration platform or work offline
  - Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download) and use [LaTeX tools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools) to integrate ST3 so you can use TeX offline
  - Please also sign up on [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com)

* Git 
  - Git is a version control system and GitHub is the service that people use to post their code in repositories. 
  - Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
  - Please sign up on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and download [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) as well 
  - Students are eligible for a [free upgrade](https://education.github.com/) so consider applying for it

* PDFs
  - [Sumatra](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org) is a lightweight PDF viewer and doesn't take forever to load documents as Acrobat sometimes does
  - If you need to do gymnastics like split and merge files then use [PDFsam Basic](https://pdfsam.org/download-pdfsam-basic/). Only get the basic version and do *NOT* check the 'install PDFsam Enhanced' when prompted during the installation process 
  - Two good OCR software are: [Solid Converter](https://www.soliddocuments.com/) and [ABBYY FineReader](https://www.abbyy.com/en-us/finereader/)

* Q-Dir
  - A good file manager is also extremely useful
  - I use [Q-Dir](https://www.softwareok.com/?Download=Q-Dir) but there might be better ones out there

* Cloud storage
  - Install [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
  - Familiarize yourself with the [folder organization plan](Dropbox-folder-organization) 
  - ISB also has 

* Bibliography management
  - I used JabRef for a long time but recently converted to Paperpile based on [recommendations by Gentzkow and Shapiro](https://github.com/gslab-econ/ra-manual/wiki/Paperpile)
  - Paperpile works only on Chrome (as of July 2019) and its so good that it convinced me to move from Firefox to Chrome.
  - Sign up for [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/) using coupon code `AADITYADAR_20`. The coupon gets you a 20% discount (and if I get 10 people to sign up, my subscription becomes free)

* Note taking
  - Google Keep is good but it's not available for offline use. Please install [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
  - Install [Webclipper](https://evernote.com/products/webclipper) extension 
  - Use webclipper to save interesting news articles (in "simplified article" format)

* Chat
  - Install [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads). It isn't as good as WhatsApp but it helps to keep professional and personal communication separate 
  - Optional: Install [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/download/) on PC/Mac

* Other software
  - [Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) for downloading files. It's particularly helpful to [spider a website](https://www.labnol.org/software/wget-command-examples/28750/) (see example #17) 
  - [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) (for PC). This is needed to connect to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or the supercomputer
  - [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) (for PC). Allows to transfer files between local and remote computer easily
  - [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). Open source file archiver that doesn't bug you with pop ups and can compress/uncompress a wide range of formats.  

* Note on screenshots tools
  - Using a screenshot tool (preferably one which allows you to add markup quickly will be useful)
  - Use Windows default's Snip and Sketch (Win+Shift+S)

  - You could also use [Jing](https://www.techsmith.com/download/jing/) or [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/download/snagit/)

* Final words:
  - Install an antivirus
  - Keep your computer updated
  - Watch out for software bloat
  - Delete software that you don't use
