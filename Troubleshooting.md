* See -help- in Stata to ensure that you have the correct syntax

* You can also post your questions on [Statalist](https://www.statalist.org/). Remember to read the [FAQs](https://www.statalist.org/forums/help) before posting, particularly "10. How should I write questions?"

> Do write carefully; be precise and include all relevant detail.
> 
> For instance,
> - Don't say "Stata crashed" when you mean "Stata issued an error message" (and then tell us the error message). Say crashed only if you mean crashed as in crashed and burned.
> - Don't say "many variables", say "around 50 variables" or, even better, "52 variables".
> - Don't say "a big dataset", say "a dataset of 50 variables and approximately a million observations".
> - Don't say "I ran a regression and then ...", say "I ran regress and then ...".
> - Please pay attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, and tidy, readable presentation generally. Statalist is naturally sympathetic whenever it is clear that English is not your first language (which is another reason to use your real name).
