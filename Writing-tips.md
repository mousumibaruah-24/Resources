William Strunk's [Elements of Style](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37134/37134-h/37134-h.htm) provides few key rules of writing clearly. See list below, and the hyperlinked text for details and examples. I would also add more to the list: write persuasively. 

> 8. Make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each topic
> 9. As a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence; end it in conformity with the beginning
> 10. Use the active voice
> 11. Put statements in positive form
> 12. Use definite, specific, concrete language
> 13. Omit needless words
> 14. Avoid a succession of loose sentences
> 15. Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form
> 16. Keep related words together
> 17. In summaries, keep to one tense
> 18. Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end
